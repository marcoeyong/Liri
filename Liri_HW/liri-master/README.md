# LIRI
LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. The user inputs a command (concert, spotify, or movie), and then their query. Liri returns the result both in the terminal as well as a log.txt file.

This project was built with node, and required the use of npm to initialize a package.json and install the dotenv, moment, node-spotify-api, and request packages.
